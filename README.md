# Home_Automation
A mini IoT project sing Arduino and ESP8266. It is basically a doorstep detection prototype, which sends an email to your specified ID when it senses someone at the door. The email also contains a link to live video footage of your camera outside the door. For the prototype model, I have used IP-Webcam app.
